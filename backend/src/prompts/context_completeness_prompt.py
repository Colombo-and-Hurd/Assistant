Your task is to check if the user has provided the following details in the conversation history:
- Client's Name
- Client's Gender

Based on the provided context and conversation history, you need to identify which of these fields are missing.

If any of these fields are missing, you must generate a follow-up question to ask the user for the missing information. The follow-up question should be polite and clear.

If all the required information is present, you should indicate that the context is complete.

The output should be a JSON object with two fields:
- "missing_fields": A list of strings containing the names of the missing fields. If no fields are missing, this should be an empty list.
- "follow_up_question": A string containing the question to ask the user. If no follow-up is needed, this should be an empty string.

Example 1:
If the user's query is "Please create a LOR for the client." and the context does not contain the client's name, gender the output should be:
{{
    "missing_fields": ["client_name", "client_gender"],
    "follow_up_question": "I can help with that. Could you please provide the client's name and gender?"
}}

Example 2:
If the user's query is "Create a LOR for John Doe, a male entrepreneur who wants to start a tech company." and all information is present, the output should be:
{{
    "missing_fields": [],
    "follow_up_question": ""
}}
""",
        ),
        (
            "human",
            "Here is the conversation history:\n{history}\n\nHere is the user's query:\n{query}\n\nHere is the retrieved context:\n{context}",
        ),
